#### Introduction
So Long is a fun little 2D maze game where player need to collect all the coins and find the way out to win. No need to worry about creating a map with enemies; the game will automatically add them if there‚Äôs enough space, and it‚Äôll still be totally playable. 

### Features  
1) **Main menu:** Player can choose your character (colored: green, red, or yellow):  
	* Use the arrow keys `‚Üê` | `‚Üí` or `A` | `D` to pick a color.  
	* Press `Enter` to start the game.  
2) **Win and lose screens.**  
3) **Enemies generated automatically:** The game adds enemies based on the map with this logic:  
	* 5% of the free spaces on the map can have enemies (this is for an "easy" difficulty level).  
	* The game will still make sure it's playable, so if it‚Äôs not, no enemies will be placed.  
	* Enemies are placed randomly on free cells using a pseudo-random number generator (`ft_rand()` from `libf`).   
	* Enemies won‚Äôt start moving until the player makes their first move, giving you some time to figure things out.  
4) **Animation support:** Enemies and collectibles have smooth animations, and everything runs at the same speed (FPS is based on speed and the number of frames in the animation).  
5) **Custom map support:**  
	* Map needs to be rectangular, surrounded by walls (`1`), and include exactly one player (`P`) and one exit (`E`), with at least one collectible (`C`).  
	* The rest of the map can have `0` as free spaces.  
	* The map file needs to have a `.ber` extension.  
	* The game will check the map and automatically generate the visuals if it‚Äôs valid.   
6) **Error handling:** If something goes wrong, a clear error message will be shown in `stdout`. There are a few types of errors:  
	* Custom errors if there‚Äôs something wrong with the map.  
	* Errors from the `MLX42` library if there's a problem on that side.  
	* System errors, like if there‚Äôs an issue with memory or reading the file.
